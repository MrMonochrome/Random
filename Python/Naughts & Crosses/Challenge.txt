Matthew's Challenge: Naughts & Crosses UI

1. Create a Fork of https://github.com/NickAllan71/Random/
    (I think you may have one already, but as it is 4yrs old it may be easier to delete this and create a fresh one)
2. Clone your new Fork
    (There are a few ways you can do this.  Try PyCharm's "Git > Clone" feature)
3. Create a branch for your changes called "Naughts_&_Crosses_UI"
    Try PyCharm's "Git > New Branch " feature

Now you can make your improvements to the project

5. Get into the habit of making frequent "Commits" as you work
    Try PyCharm's "Git > Commit"
6. Tick "Changes" to files you want to commit
7. Add a commit message .  E.g. "Adding UI"
8. "Commit and Push..."

Once you're finished with all your improvements and have "Pushed" your final "Commit"...

9. Create a Pull Request
    Try PyCharm's "Git > Github > Create Pull Request" feature
10. Base fork Repository should be "Random" with branch "origin/master"
11. Head fork Repository should be your fork and your branch.  E.g. "Naughts_&_Crosses_UI"
10. Add a Title "Naughts & Crosses UI"
10. Assign me as a Reviewer
11. Click "Create Pull Request"

I should then receive your pull request with the option to merge in your improvements.
